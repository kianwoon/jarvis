print("1. PROBLEM SUMMARY:")
print("   - Both RAG and RAG_TEMP showed hardcoded 80% scores")
print("   - Real similarity scores from vector search were lost")
print("   - Users couldn't assess relevance of search results\n")

print("2. ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:")
print("   a) Frontend display conversion:")
print("      - relevance_score was hardcoded to 0.8 in service.py")
print("   b) Regular RAG flow:")
print("      - Scores from Milvus were not preserved in filtered_docs")
print("      - source_info didn't include score field")
print("   c) Temp document flow:")
print("      - hybrid_context extraction didn't preserve scores\n")

print("3. FIXES APPLIED:")
print("   ✅ service.py line ~3569: Use actual score instead of hardcoded 0.8")
print("   ✅ service.py line ~3710: Use actual score instead of hardcoded 0.8")
print("   ✅ service.py line ~2589: Preserve score when extracting from hybrid_context")
print("   ✅ service.py line ~2250: Keep track of scores in filtered_docs_with_scores")
print("   ✅ service.py line ~2279: Include score in source_info for regular RAG\n")

print("4. DATA FLOW WITH SCORES:")
print("   Regular RAG:")
print("   Milvus → (doc, score) → filtered_and_ranked → filtered_docs_with_scores")
print("         → source_info with score → frontend display")
print("")
print("   Temp Documents (RAG_TEMP):")
print("   In-memory search → sources with scores → hybrid_context")
print("                   → source_info with score → frontend display\n")

print("5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:")
print("   Before: All documents show 80.0%")
print("   After:  Real scores like 95.2%, 87.3%, 72.1%, etc.\n")

print("   1. Ask a question that triggers RAG search")
print("   2. Check the document scores in the UI")
print("   3. Scores should vary (not all 80%)")
