  "reminder": "\n\ud83e\udd16 AGENT DELEGATION REQUIRED\n============================\nClaude Code operates in READ-ONLY mode. All execution must be delegated to agents.\n\n\ud83d\udccb Task Analysis:\n- Task Type: optimization\n- Recommended Agents: Senior Code Agent, Code Agent, General Purpose Agent\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Selected Agents:\n\n\u2022 Senior Code Agent (senior-coder.md)\n  Reason: Detected keywords: performance\n  Relevance Score: 0.30\n\u2022 Code Agent (coder.md)\n  Reason: Detected keywords: optimize\n  Relevance Score: 0.27\n\u2022 General Purpose Agent (general-purpose.md)\n  Reason: Pattern matching and context analysis\n  Relevance Score: 0.25\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT REMINDERS:\n1. You (Claude) can ONLY read and analyze code\n2. ALL modifications must go through agents\n3. Use request_agent_work.py for delegation\n4. Never use Write, Edit, or Execute tools directly\n5. Agents handle all execution and modifications\n\n\ud83d\udccc Next Steps:\n1. Analyze the request using Read/Grep/Glob tools\n2. Create a plan for the agents\n3. Delegate work using the command above\n4. Monitor progress with BashOutput\n5. Verify results through reading\n\nRemember: You are the architect and analyzer. Agents are the builders.\n",
