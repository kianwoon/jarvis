DBS Bank has been exploring Ant Group's OceanBase database technology. The bank aims to strengthen its technology infrastructure and gain competitive advantages in scalability. 

Embracing such platforms is consistent with DBS's goal of simplifying its tech stack and supporting microservices architecture. Innovation requires ecosystem ambitions that enable rapid development.

Another strategic motive is DBS's desire to create new digital offerings and ecosystems quickly. The bank has broadened its business model to act as a technology platform, integrating banking services with digital marketplaces.

OceanBase and TDSQL can handle surges in user activity without compromising performance. These technologies serve DBS's strategic goal of being a nimble organization that is customer-focused.

Both banks and tech competitors recognize that distributed databases like OceanBase provide significant advantages. As demonstrated in China's financial industry, these solutions can handle extreme transaction volumes.
