This solution implements a GENERAL approach to prevent information mixing:

1. **Primary Subject Extraction**:
   - Automatically identifies the main entity/topic from ANY query
   - Works with products, companies, technologies, places, concepts
   - Prioritizes quoted terms, proper nouns, and product tiers
   - NO HARDCODING of specific companies or products

2. **Enhanced Search Result Formatting**:
   - Adds PRIMARY SUBJECT to search result headers
   - Includes relevance filtering instructions for EACH result
   - Reminds the LLM to verify relevance before using any fact
   - Works for ANY entity type, not just specific products

3. **System Prompt Enhancements**:
   - Added GENERAL ENTITY DISAMBIGUATION rules
   - Teaches the LLM to identify primary subjects
   - Provides strategies for distinguishing between entities
   - Emphasizes verification before information inclusion

4. **Key Implementation Files Modified**:
   - /app/api/v1/endpoints/langchain.py: Added extract_primary_subject()
   - /app/api/v1/endpoints/langchain.py: Enhanced search result formatting
   - /app/langchain/service.py: Updated system prompt with disambiguation rules

5. **Key Principles**:
   - NO HARDCODING of specific entities
   - Works for ANY type of query
   - Focuses on teaching the LLM to filter, not pre-filtering
   - Emphasizes omission over incorrect attribution

This solution is SCALABLE and MAINTAINABLE because it doesn't require
updating code when new products/entities are introduced.
