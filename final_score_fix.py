print("1. ROOT CAUSE FOUND:")
print("   - Milvus returns (doc, distance) tuples")
print("   - Distance is converted to similarity: similarity = 1 - (distance / 2)")
print("   - filtered_and_ranked contains 5-tuple:")
print("     (doc, distance, similarity, keyword_relevance, combined_score)")
print("   - We were extracting item[1] which is the DISTANCE, not similarity!")
print("   - Distance values are typically small (< 0.4), causing low scores\n")

print("   Changed from: score = item[1]  # This was the distance!")
print("   Changed to:   score = item[2]  # This is the similarity score")

print("\n5. WHAT USERS WILL SEE:")
print("   ✅ Variable scores based on actual similarity")
print("   ✅ Higher scores = better matches")
