print("1. ISSUE IDENTIFIED:")
print("   Your query went through the TOOL execution path, not regular RAG")
print("   - Query classified as 'tool' type → executes knowledge_search tool")
print("   - Results come from MCP RAG service (via cache)")
print("   - Scores were being calculated by position, not actual similarity\n")

print("2. ROOT CAUSES FOUND:")
print("   a) In service.py:")
print("      - Tool results extraction didn't include score field")
print("      - Regular RAG was using distance instead of similarity")
print("   ")
print("   b) In rag_mcp_service.py:")
print("      - Was using position-based scoring (0.9^i)")
print("      - Ignored actual scores from search results\n")

print("3. FIXES APPLIED:")
print("   ")
print("   ✅ service.py line ~2250:")
print("      Changed: score = item[1]  # distance")
print("      To:      score = item[2]  # similarity")
print("   ")
print("   ✅ service.py lines ~2719, ~3145, ~3229:")
print("      Added: 'score': doc.get('relevance_score', doc.get('score', 0.8))")
print("   ")
print("   ✅ rag_mcp_service.py line ~573:")
print("      Now checks for actual scores before using position-based fallback")
print("      actual_score = source.get('score', source.get('relevance_score', None))\n")

print("4. SCORE FLOW PATHS:")
print("   ")
print("   Path 1: Regular RAG Query")
print("   User → Query classified as RAG → handle_rag_query → Milvus search")
print("        → Returns (doc, distance) → Convert to similarity → Display")
print("   ")
print("   Path 2: Tool Execution (your case)")
print("   User → Query classified as TOOL → knowledge_search → MCP RAG service")
print("        → handle_rag_query → Get sources with scores → Format & return\n")

print("5. DEBUGGING:")
print("   With new debug logging, you'll see:")
print("   - '[DEBUG] handle_rag_query: Sources with scores:'")
print("   - '[RAG MCP DEBUG] Doc 0: file=..., score=...'")
print("   - '[DEBUG] rag_answer: Converting X rag_sources to documents'")
print("   ")
print("   This will show if scores are flowing through correctly\n")

print("6. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:")
print("   ✅ Scores will vary based on actual similarity")
print("   ✅ No more constant 80% for all documents")
print("   ✅ Works for both RAG and TOOL execution paths")
print("   ✅ Falls back to position-based only if no scores available")

print("\n=== Complete Fix Applied ✨ ===")
print("\nNote: Clear any caches to see the fix in action!")
print("The RAG MCP service uses caching, so cached results may still show old scores.")
